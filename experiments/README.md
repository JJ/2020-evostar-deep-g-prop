# Running instructions

First, you need a python < 3.9, because that version is not compatible
with tensorflow. You probably need to install cudart, but it only
works with version 11 and if you have a GPU on the machine. Install it
[following instructions
here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&target_distro=Ubuntu&target_version=2004&target_type=deblocal)
(or similar ones for other operating systems)

and then

    pip install -r requirements.txt
