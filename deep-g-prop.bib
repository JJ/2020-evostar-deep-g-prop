abstract = {The paper presents a new approach to optimize the Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN), to deal with the generalization problem. As known, most supervised learning algorithms aim to minimize the training error. However, the mentioned methods, based only on error minimizing, may generate a solution with an insufficient generalization performance. This present work proposes a multiobjective modelling problem involving two objectives: accuracy and complexity since the learning problem is multiobjective by nature. The learning task is carried on by minimizing both objectives simultaneously, according to Pareto domination concept, using NSGAII (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) as a solver. This method leads us to a set of solutions called Pareto front, being the optimal solutions set, the adequate MLPNN need to be extracted. We show empirically that the proposed method is capable of reducing the neural networks topology and improved generalization performance, in addition to a good classification rate compared to different methods.}

abstract = "Breast Cancer is a common disease and to prevent it, the disease must be identified at earlier stages. Available breast cancer datasets are unbalanced in nature, i.e. there are more instances of benign (non-cancerous) cases then malignant (cancerous) ones. Therefore, it is a challenging task for most machine learning (ML) models to classify between benign and malignant cases properly, even though they have high accuracy. Accuracy is not a good metric to assess the results of ML models on breast cancer dataset because of biased results. To address this issue, we use Genetic Programming (GP) and propose two fitness functions. First one is F2 score which focuses on learning more about the minority class, which contains more relevant information, the second one is a novel fitness function known as Distance score (D score) which learns about both the classes by giving them equal importance and being unbiased. The GP framework in which we implemented D score is named as D-score GP (DGP) and the framework implemented with F2 score is named as F2GP. The proposed F2GP achieved a maximum accuracy of 99.63\%, 99.51\% and 100\% for 60-40, 70-30 partition schemes and 10 fold cross validation scheme respectively and DGP achieves a maximum accuracy of 99.63\%, 98.5\% and 100\% in 60-40, 70-30 partition schemes and 10 fold cross validation scheme respectively. The proposed models also achieves a recall of 100\% for all the test cases. This shows that using a new fitness function for unbalanced data classification improves the performance of a classifier."

abstract="The attractive characteristics of the cloud computing environment encourage its growth and penetration in various sections of society like government, education, entertainment, etc. The large-scale adoption of cloud computing not only provides services to users but also presents a wide attack landscape to the attackers and intruders in order to perform sophisticated attacks. Widespread implementation of cloud computing and its distributed and decentralized existence makes this computing paradigm prone to intrusion and attacks. Thus, the creation of network intrusion detection framework using anomaly detection method for cloud computing network with a better assault identification level and less false positives is essential. This paper discusses an effective network-based intrusion detection model utilizing artificial neural network strategies such as multilayer perceptron programmed with a genetic algorithm, as well as compares it using other machine learning techniques. The genetic algorithm was incorporated in multiple layer perceptron to predict the connection weights. Standard IDS dataset, namely CICIDS 2017, was used for simulation and testing of the suggested model. The results of implementation demonstrate the ability of the proposed model in the identification of intrusions in the cloud environment with a higher rate of detection and generation of minimal false alarm warnings, which suggests its dominance relative to state-of-the-art approaches. The implementation results show an accuracy of 90{\%}.",

The multilayer perceptron (MLP) architecture and cascaded MLP architecture of artificial neural network are employed to model temperature dependence of 2-mm GaN-on-silicon device. It is identified that both architectures face problem of dependence on initials values of weights and biases. To overcome this issue, the genetic algorithm (GA) is incorporated in both MLP and cascaded MLP architectures. The models are trained on a large set of operating conditions (bias voltages and ambient temperatures) over a frequency range of 0.1 to 20âGHz and then tested for both temperature interpolation and extrapolation cases to assess their accuracy and robustness. An excellent agreement between the measured and the modeled S-parameters over the entire frequency range demonstrate the quality and robustness of the proposed technique. It is also shown that the cascaded MLP with GA exhibits better performance but with increased complexity.},

abstract = "Training an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm is not trivial, which requires optimizing a set of weights and biases that increase dramatically with the increasing capacity of the neural network resulting in such hard optimization problems. Essentially, over recent decades, stochastic search algorithms have shown remarkable abilities for addressing hard optimization problems. On the other hand, pragmatically, abundant real-world problems suffer from the imbalance problem, where the distribution of data varies considerably among classes resulting in more training biases and variances which degrades the performance of the learning algorithm. This paper introduces three stochastic and metaheuristic algorithms for training the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network to solve the problem of imbalanced classifications. The utilized algorithms are the Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). The proposed GWO-MLP, PSO-MLP, and SSA-MLP are trained based on different objective functions; accuracy, f1-score, and g-mean. Whereas, it is evaluated based on 10 benchmark imbalanced datasets. The results show an advantage for f1-score, and g-mean fitness functions over the accuracy when the datasets are imbalanced."

Impact of independent variables such as, light (UV: on-off), solution pH (5â8), composite weight (CW: 0.5â1Â mg), initial dye concentration (DC: 10â20Â mg/l) and contact time (0â120Â min), mainly in two levels, were examined to evaluate dye removal efficiency of the composite. According to the developed response surface based on the factorial design, all independent variables shown positive interactive effect on dye removal (UVÂ >Â CWÂ >Â pHÂ >Â DC), as well as the pH-CW mutual interaction, while both UV-DC and CW-DC had antagonistic effect. The pH-CW interaction was more influential than pH and DC. Incorporation of the intermediate measurements of dye removal between the start and final contact times in GA-MLP approach, had found to improve the accuracy and predictability of the GA-MLP model. Based on the closeness of the R2 (0.98), root mean square error (1.03), variance accounted for (98.23\%), mean absolute error (0.61) and model predictive error (9.46\%) to their desirable levels, proposed GA-MLP model outperformed the factorial design model. Finally, optimal parameter choice for maximum dye removal using factorial design and GA-MLP were found as: UV (on), pH (9), CW (1Â g) and DC (10Â mg/l) and UV (on), pH (8.85), CW (0.92Â g), DC (12.3Â mg/l) and T (117 0.6Â min), respectively."

This prevents the use of traditional interrater reliability metrics like the Îº statistic to assess the quality of expert-generated gold standards. Such studies often quantify system performance as precision, recall, and F-measure, or as agreement. It can be shown that the average F-measure among pairs of experts is numerically identical to the average positive specific agreement among experts and that Îº approaches these measures as the number of negative cases grows large. Positive specific agreementâor the equivalent F-measureâmay be an appropriate way to quantify interrater reliability and therefore to assess the reliability of a gold standard in these studies.}",

abstract = "This paper evaluates the performance of different evolutionary neural network models in a problem of solar radiation prediction at Toledo, Spain. The prediction problem has been tackled exclusively from satellite-based measurements and variables, which avoids the use of data from ground stations or atmospheric soundings. Specifically, three types of neural computation approaches are considered: neural networks with sigmoid-based neurons, radial basis function units and product units. In all cases these neural computation algorithms are trained by means of evolutionary algorithms, leading to robust and accurate models for solar radiation prediction. The results obtained in the solar radiation estimation at the radiometric station of Toledo show an excellent performance of evolutionary neural networks tested. The structure sigmoid unit-product unit with evolutionary training has been shown as the best model among all tested in this paper, able to obtain an extremely accurate prediction of the solar radiation from satellite images data, and outperforming all other evolutionary neural networks tested, and alternative Machine Learning approaches such as Support Vector Regressors or Extreme Learning Machines."

In this paper, we design a spotted hyena optimizer for training feedforward neural network (FNN), which is regarded as a challenging task since it is easy to fall into local optima. Our objective is to apply metaheuristic optimization algorithm to tackle this problem better than the mathematical and deterministic methods. In order to confirm that using SHO to train FNN is more effective, five classification datasets and three function-approximations are applied to benchmark the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed SHO algorithm for optimization FNN has the best comprehensive performance and has more outstanding performance than other the state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms in terms of the performance measures."
